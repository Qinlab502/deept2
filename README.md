# deept2
DeepT2 utilizes deep learning techniques to identify type II polyketide (T2PK) synthases KSβ and their corresponding T2PK product within bacterial genomes. The method leverages ESM2 to transform KSβ sequences into embeddings, which are employed to train two separate classifiers using multi-layer perceptron for both KSβ and T2PKs classification.
