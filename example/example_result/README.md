We are pleased to provide an example genome named Strepomyces kanamyceticus, which has been reported to biosynthesize Fasamycin (Accramycin)(citation:https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c01089). \
Our model has successfully identified three ksb sequences involved in the biosynthesis of T2PK compounds in this genome. \
Through accurate prediction, we have confirmed the production of Fasamycin (Accramycin) through metabolomic experiments. \
However, the other two T2PK compounds were not detected in the crude extraction, possibly indicating that they are in a silent state. You can find the prediction results in the file named "example_prediction.txt".
